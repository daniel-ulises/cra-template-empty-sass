# cra-template-sass-empty

With this template you will quickly get started with **React** and **Sass** in one command. It will install the **sass** dependency and also create a basic folder structure inside of your **src** folder, with pre-defined folders and files in them.

To use this template simply use the following command and get to work faster.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template sass-empty
```

To start watching the **_SASS_** files, there is a script for that.
This will watch the **_main.scss_** file only, and it will output a **_main.css_** in your **/src** folder.

```sh
# For NPM
npm run watch

#  For Yarn
yarn watch
```
